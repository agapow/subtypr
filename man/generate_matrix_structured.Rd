\title{Generate synthetic data based on a real dataset.}
\usage{
generate_matrix_structured(data_support, structure_type = c("basic",
  "moClus"), separation = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_support}{a list of features matrices used to generate the
data}

\item{structure_type}{the type of structure, "moClus" is inspired from
moCluster: Identifying Joint Patterns Across Multiple Omics Data Sets, DOI:
10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00824}

\item{separation}{double. The value of separation between clusters: the space
between the means of the normal distributions used to generate the
structure of the synthetic data.}
}
\value{
a list of synthetic features matrix with the same dimension than the
\code{data_support}
}
